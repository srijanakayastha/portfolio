# Portfolio of Srijana Kayastha
### This is my Portfolio for the assignments that I've done during the Software Engineering Program at Masterschool.

## 1. First assignment is creating a portfolio.
## 2. Second is to create the STLC folder that contains the written exercises.
## 3. Based on the vague requirements, I've asked questions to find out how exactly should each feature work
## 4. I tested each feature on the system under test to answer each question and developed for each feature the detailed requirement
## 5. Wrote and updated the test plan, answering the questions: What is the objective of the test plan?; Who will the product be used by? Who are your user stakeholders?; What is the functionality of the product? Existing and to be added functionality; Which functionalities are in scope of testing?; What is out of scope for testing?; What types of testing is necessary for the new functionalities?
## 6. Designed the test cases for each new feature
## 7. Executed the test cases and reported the issues found while executing them
