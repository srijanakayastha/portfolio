# **Test Plan for Webshop Enhancements**

## **1. Analyze the Product**

### **Objective**

The primary objective of the product is to enhance the existing webshop by introducing new features and ensuring the smooth functioning of existing functionalities.

### **User Base**

Primary users (end users, customers):
1. Not logged-in guest users (visitors browsing products without an account, can search, filter, and view products, may attempt to add items to favorites or basket)
2. Logged-in users (users with an account who can log in, can add products to favorites and basket, can place orders and go through the checkout process, can rate products and leave written feedback)
3. Adult users (users eligible to purchase alcoholic products, must pass age verification to access alcohol categories)
4. Underage users (users who should not be able to access alcoholic products)

Secondary users (business owners/product managers, customer support staff, marketing team, developers, testers):
These users have different responsibilities on the webshop running smooth for the primary users.

- **Security:** No significant vulnerabilities are detected.
- **Usability:** Users can navigate and use the platform easily.

## **4. Define Test Criteria**

### **Suspension Criteria**

- Testing will be suspended if critical defects are found that block further testing.
- Lack of necessary resources or test environment failures.

### **Exit Criteria**

- All planned tests have been executed.
- Run Rate: At least 95% of all test cases have been executed.
- Pass Rate: At least 90% of executed test cases have passed.
- All critical and high-priority defects have been resolved and closed.
- No severity 1 or severity 2 defects are open.
- Performance metrics meet the defined standards.
- Security vulnerabilities have been identified and addressed.
- User acceptance testing has been completed, and sign-off has been obtained.

## **5. Resource Planning**
